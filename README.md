# Simple 3D Robotic Arm – Tinkercad

> A basic 3D model of a robotic arm created using Tinkercad, designed as an educational introduction to 3D modeling and robotics concepts.

## Tools Used
- **Tinkercad** – for 3D modeling
- **Basic Shapes** – boxes, cylinders, etc.
- **Grouping & Alignment** – to combine parts into a single arm-like structure

##  Model Structure
- A base shape representing the robot’s foundation
- A vertical arm section extending upward
- A simple end piece symbolizing the hand or gripper

> The model does not include real joints, rotation, or servos. It is purely visual and static.
